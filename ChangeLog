	- Added a result print (T,c) where T is temperature and c is cost to
	  measure progress of simulated annealing. The print is tagged
	  "best_cost_so_far".

	- Fixed a non-fatal (by luck) bug in ae_print_mapping_balance() that
	  indexed out of bounds on target_pes table. Target_pes was allocated
	  to be of size ntasks but it should have been of size npes. In all
	  test cases so far ntasks was higher than npes so no problem occured.

	- Fixed the b-level scheduler. It could have chosen a wrong path
	  when choosing the path with highest b-level value, and it probably
	  did. Although I didn't see the fix improve execution time
	  noticeably.
	- Wrote arexanalyzer.py. It analyzes outputs of arex program. It lets
	  user decide on interesting properties, and then selects that data
	  from the given data set. Example:
	    echo MARK task_graph_file
	    arexrun1 >> resultfile
	    echo MARK task_graph_file
	    arexrun2 >> resultfile
	    ...
	    echo MARK task_graph_file
	    arexrun100 >> resultfile
	    arexanalyzer.py --objective_function="execution_time" --optimization_method="simulated_annealing" --sa_heuristics="rm" --ntasks="52" --pes="2" --summary="summaryfile" resultfile
	  Now "summaryfile" contains statistics on arex runs.
	- Added random mapping heuristics
	- Modularized heuritics parameters in optimization.[ch]. Different
	  mapping heuristics share the same variable in struct ae_optimization.
	  (struct ae_optimization foo.params)
	- All mapping heuristics do
	    fprintf(stderr, "accepted_objective: %.9lf\n", bestcost)
	  to indicate the best objective value so far. This feature is useful
	  for plotting optimization progress.
	- Wrote an initial version of contrib/arex-import-xsm.py that imports
	  xsm models from Koski design flow. It still lacks graph generation,
	  because current arex doesn't support probabilistic triggers for
	  tasks.
	- Lots of other changes changes

	- Using getrusage() to determine how much CPU time arex process has
	  from the kernel.

2005-07-26  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@tut.fi>
	- Finished first version of full memory tracking. It will probably
	  break in the future due to complexity of schedule.c.

	- Tedious work on schedulers memory reference counting. Need to
	  keep track of memory allocated for input and output of tasks.
	  This gets complicated when each task computes many results, and
	  each result is divided into many partitions. Each partitions is
	  sent to exactly one target PE.

2005-06-19  Heikki Orsila <heikki.orsila@tut.fi>
	- fixed a very serious bug in memory allocation macros. always use ()
	  over variables in #defines. following macro was buggy in a very
	  serious way (see arexbasic.h):

	  #define MALLOC_ARRAY(array, n) do { array = malloc(sizeof(array[0]) * n); } while(0)

	  Now MALLOC_ARRAY(array, amount + 1) would allocate only
                1 + amount * sizeof(array[0])
          bytes, instead of
	        (1 + amount) * sizeof(array[0])

	- initial changelog entry. rewriting the python optimizer.
