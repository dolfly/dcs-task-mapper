The intended coding style the project is the Linux kernel coding style.

The correct style is K&R with 8 column indentation by using tabs.
Tab means 8 columns.

However, there are many old code modules that use 2 column indentation.
These modules will be gradually moved to the Linux kernel style
(8 column indentation).
